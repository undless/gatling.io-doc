## Introduction

You can configure Gatling Enterprise to send notifications about your simulation runs results directly with Slack. 

Notifications will be sent as soon as a simulation run ends, and will display:
- A summary of your simulation info
- The run result (Successful, Assertions failure, etc.)
- Assertions results, if you configured any in your simulation

## Configuration

Navigate to your organization configuration page, and to the **Notifications** tab.

From there, you will be able to activate and configure notifications for your communication tools:

Click on the toggle to activate notifications.

Paste your webhook URL in the text field, then you can test and save it:

- The **Test** button sends a hello world message to your webhook before saving it.
- **Save** persists your configuration. The next simulation runs will send a notification at the end.

To deactivate notifications, click on the toggle, and confirm your choice.

A note about data security:
- Your webhook URL is ciphered before being stored in our database.
- Deactivating notifications deletes the webhook URL from configuration, we do not keep it in our database.
