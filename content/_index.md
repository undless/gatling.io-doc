**Gatling is a high-performance load testing tool built for efficiency, automation, and code-driven testing workflows.**

Test scenarios are defined as code using an expressive DSL in Java, JavaScript, Scala, or Kotlin, making them easy to read, version, and maintain as part of your development workflow.

Gatling’s architecture is fully asynchronous. Virtual users are modeled as lightweight messages rather than threads, allowing you to simulate thousands of concurrent users with minimal system resources, ideal for modern, high-scale applications.

While Gatling offers robust support for **HTTP** out of the box, the load engine is protocol-agnostic. It also ships with **JMS** support and can be extended to handle other protocols.

## Need centralized test management and real-time reporting?

**Gatling Enterprise** extends the open-source capabilities with:

- A web UI to manage, launch, and monitor tests
- Real-time dashboards with detailed analytics
- CI/CD integration, advanced permissions, and support for hybrid/cloud deployments
