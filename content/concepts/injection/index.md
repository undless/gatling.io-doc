The definition of the injection profile of users is done with the `injectOpen` and `injectClosed` methods (just `inject` in Scala). This method takes as an argument a sequence of injection steps that will be processed sequentially.

## Open model

### Core components {#open-model-core}

{{< include-code "open-injection" >}}

The building blocks for open model profile injection are:

1. `nothingFor(duration)`: Pause for a given duration.
2. `atOnceUsers(nbUsers)`: Injects a given number of users at once.
3. `rampUsers(nbUsers).during(duration)`: Injects a given number of users distributed evenly on a time window of a given duration.
4. `constantUsersPerSec(rate).during(duration)`: Injects users at a constant rate, defined in users per second, during a given duration. Users will be injected at regular intervals.
5. `constantUsersPerSec(rate).during(duration).randomized`: Injects users at a constant rate, defined in users per second, during a given duration. Users will be injected at randomized intervals.
6. `rampUsersPerSec(rate1).to(rate2).during(duration)`: Injects users from starting rate to target rate, defined in users per second, during a given duration. Users will be injected at regular intervals.
7. `rampUsersPerSec(rate1).to(rate2).during(duration).randomized`: Injects users from starting rate to target rate, defined in users per second, during a given duration. Users will be injected at randomized intervals.
8. `stressPeakUsers(nbUsers).during(duration)`: Injects a given number of users following a smooth approximation of the [heaviside step function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function) stretched to a given duration.

Rates can be expressed as fractional values.

### Stairs {#open-model-stairs}

Quite often, you'll want to build capacity tests where you progressively increase the load with a sequence of ramps and levels.
While it's entirely possible to build this kind of **open model** injection profile manually from individual blocks,
Gatling provides a built-in helper named `incrementUsersPerSec`.

{{< include-code "incrementUsersPerSec" >}}

`separatedByRampsLasting` and `startingFrom` are both optional.
If you don't specify a ramp, the test will jump from one level to another as soon as it is finished.
If you don't specify the number of starting users the test will start at 0 user per sec and will go to the next step right away.

## Closed model

### Core components {#closed-model-core}

{{< include-code "closed-injection" >}}

The building blocks for closed model profile injection are:

1. `constantConcurrentUsers(nbUsers).during(duration)`: Inject so that number of concurrent users in the system is constant
2. `rampConcurrentUsers(fromNbUsers).to(toNbUsers).during(duration)`: Inject so that number of concurrent users in the system ramps linearly from a number to another

{{< alert warning >}}
Ramping down the number of concurrent users won't force the existing users to interrupt.
The only way for virtual users to terminate is to complete their scenario.

### Stairs {#closed-model-stairs}

While it's entirely possible to build this kind of **closed model** injection profile manually from individual blocks,
Gatling provides a built-in helper named `incrementConcurrentUsers`.

{{< include-code "incrementConcurrentUsers" >}}

`separatedByRampsLasting` and `startingFrom` are both optional.
If you don't specify a ramp, the test will jump from one level to another as soon as it is finished.
If you don't specify the number of starting users the test will start at 0 concurrent user and will go to the next step right away.

## Chaining injection steps

For a given scenario, you can pass a sequence of injection steps.
They must all be of the model kind.
The next injection step will start when all the virtual users defined by the current one have started.

{{< include-code "chainingInjectionSteps" >}}

## Concurrent scenarios

You can configure multiple scenarios in the same `setUp` block to start at the same time and execute concurrently.

{{< include-code "concurrentScenarios" >}}

## Sequential scenarios

It's also possible with `andThen` to chain scenarios, so that children scenarios start once all the users in the parent scenario terminate.

{{< include-code "andThen" >}}

When chaining `andThen` calls, Gatling will define the new children to only start once all the users of the previous children have terminated, descendants included.

## Disabling Gatling Enterprise load sharding

By default, Gatling Enterprise will distribute your injection profile amongst all load generators when running a distributed test from multiple nodes.

This might not be the desired behavior, typically when running a first initial scenario with one single user in order to fetch some auth token to be used by the actual scenario.
Indeed, only one node would run this user, leaving the other nodes without an initialized token.

You can use `noShard` to disable load sharding. In this case, all the nodes will use the injection and throttling profiles as defined in the Simulation.
